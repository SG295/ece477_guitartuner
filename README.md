Please make a branch for your respective part and title it according (i.e. if you're working on the motor, you can just title it "motor").

The command to create a branch (do this locally after you've pulled):
  * git checkout -b NEW_BRANCH_NAME

The commands (in order) to push your NEW branch: 
  * git add .
  * git commit -m "put message here"
  * git push origin -u NEW_BRANCH_NAME
   
**Once you have created and pushed the branch, you can push normally if you're on the branch. You can check this with "git branch".**

I have setup a platoform IO project here with basic settings with the STM32F407VG Discovery Boards we have at our table (looks like the image below). I'll list some documentation that will be useful:
